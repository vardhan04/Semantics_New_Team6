This project is about Semantic Data Generation where input datasets are converted are into RDF(Resource Description Framework) files. The ontology of the generated RDF file is then visualized using Protégé Ontology Editor.

Technology stack requirements-

Protégé Ontology Editor, Python, RDFLIB library (can be installed using "pip install rdflib" and "pip install pandas), Visual Studio Code

To generate RDF file - Please run the "combined.py" python file, where the csv input files are "reduced_dataset11.csv " and "reduced_dataset2.csv"

After sucessfully executing the python code- The (.rdf) files are generated, in this case it is "example.rdf".

We can visualize the final converted rdf file in Protégé Editor.
